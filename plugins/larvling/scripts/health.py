"""Recording-health tracking — makes silent recording failures loud.

Larvling records entirely through Claude Code hooks. Two ways recording can
stop without any indication:

* **Case A — a hook runs but its DB write throws** (locked DB, disk full, a
  schema mismatch). The script exits non-zero, Claude Code swallows the error,
  and nothing is recorded. `record_failure()` drops a one-shot marker so the
  next turn can warn the user; `pending_failure()`/`clear_failure()` read and
  consume it.

* **Case B — the hooks stop running entirely** (a broken plugin cache). Nothing
  inside the plugin executes, so it can't report its own absence in real time.
  `recording_gap()` catches this on the *next* working session by reconciling
  Larvling's recorded sessions against Claude Code's own per-project transcript
  files — which exist for every session regardless of Larvling's health.
