# Larvling

> Your friendly memory companion. Every conversation is remembered.

Everything lives in `.claude/larvling.db` (SQLite, WAL mode).

## First Run

When the SessionStart context contains "Larvling - First Run", this is the very first time Larvling has been installed. You MUST welcome the user before doing anything else. Keep it warm, brief, and conversational - something like a friendly companion introducing itself. Include:
- That Larvling is now installed and will quietly remember their sessions
- That everything is automatic - no setup or extra effort needed
- Mention the available skills naturally: `/remember` to store knowledge, `/recall` to search it, `/forget` to remove it, `/sessions` to browse past sessions, `/summarize` for session summaries, `/export` to save a conversation as markdown, `/status` for a quick overview, `/maintain` to audit and consolidate knowledge, `/query` for direct SQL access
- Do NOT list technical details, hook names, or internal architecture. Keep the magic behind the curtain.

## Update Notice

When the SessionStart context contains "Larvling update available", mention it once to the user at the start of the conversation. Keep it brief - one sentence is enough. Don't repeat it later in the session.

## During a Session

Review the context Larvling injects at session start — it's your memory of what came before. Recording is automatic — just focus on the work.

### Session Start Menu

After reviewing the injected context, offer a welcome menu on the **first user message** using AskUserQuestion (type: Decision). Tailor the options to what's in the context:

- If there are **open tasks**, include: **Pick up a task** — resume work on an open task
- If there are **recent sessions**, include: **Continue where I left off** — pick up from the last session's topic
- Always include: **Start fresh** — begin something new

Keep the greeting brief (one sentence acknowledging the context), then present the menu. Skip the menu if the user's first message is already a specific question or command — don't interrupt them.

### Schema Migration

When the SessionStart context contains "Schema Migration Required", the database schema needs updating.
Read the current and desired schemas provided, write and run the SQL to migrate (preserving all data), then bump the version in `larvling/db.py` with the provided command.
A backup of the database has already been created.

**SQLite migration rules (MUST follow):**

1. **Simple additions** (new column, new table, new index) — use `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` or `CREATE TABLE/INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` directly. No table rebuild needed.
2. **Adding CHECK constraints to existing columns** — existing data may not conform to the new constraint. Always `SELECT DISTINCT <column>` first and `UPDATE` non-conforming values before rebuilding the table with the constraint. Use the 12-step rebuild pattern below.
3. **Column rename/type change/FK change** — SQLite requires the 12-step rebuild pattern:
   - `PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF`
   - `BEGIN TRANSACTION`
   - `CREATE TABLE <new_table> (...)` with the correct schema
   - `INSERT INTO <new_table> SELECT ... FROM <old_table>`
   - `DROP TABLE <old_table>`
   - `ALTER TABLE <new_table> RENAME TO <old_table>`
   - Rebuild **every table** that has a FK referencing the rebuilt table (same pattern)
   - Rebuild any indexes/triggers on affected tables
   - `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` — must return zero rows
   - `COMMIT`
   - `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`
4. **Never leave temp tables behind** — no `_old`, `_backup`, `_temp` tables should exist after migration.
5. **Always verify FKs** — run `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` and confirm empty result.
6. **Verify with `get_current_schema()`** — after migration, compare live schema against `get_desired_schema()`. They must match (ignoring whitespace).

### `/query` - Direct SQL Access

Use `/query` to run any SQL against larvling.db. Claude writes the SQL based on conversation context. Supports `--read-only` flag to restrict to SELECT/PRAGMA/EXPLAIN only (used by the extraction agent).

**Schema:**
- `sessions (id TEXT PK, started_at TEXT, ended_at TEXT, duration_min REAL, title TEXT, agent_summary TEXT, exchange_count INT, summary_at TEXT, summary_msg_count INT, tags TEXT, summary_offered INT DEFAULT 0)`
- `messages (id INT PK AUTO, session_id TEXT FK, timestamp TEXT, role TEXT [user|assistant|system], content TEXT, metadata TEXT)`
- `topics (id INTEGER PK AUTO, title TEXT NOT NULL, domain TEXT NOT NULL, tags TEXT NOT NULL, created TEXT, updated TEXT)`
- `statements (id INTEGER PK AUTO, topic_id INTEGER FK→topics(id), claim TEXT NOT NULL, created TEXT, updated TEXT)`
- `tasks (id INTEGER PK AUTO, title TEXT NOT NULL, domain TEXT NOT NULL, status TEXT DEFAULT 'open', priority TEXT DEFAULT 'medium', horizon TEXT DEFAULT 'later', metadata TEXT, created TEXT)`
- `updates (id INTEGER PK AUTO, task_id INTEGER FK→tasks(id), content TEXT NOT NULL, timestamp TEXT)`

**Examples:**

```
/query "SELECT t.id, t.title, s.claim FROM topics t JOIN statements s ON s.topic_id = t.id"
/query "SELECT t.id, t.title, s.claim FROM topics t JOIN statements s ON s.topic_id = t.id WHERE s.claim LIKE '%deploy%' OR t.tags LIKE '%ci%'"
/query "SELECT id, title, agent_summary FROM sessions WHERE agent_summary IS NOT NULL ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 5"
/query "SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status = 'open' ORDER BY priority"
/query "SELECT * FROM messages WHERE content LIKE '%auth%' LIMIT 10" --json
```

**Quick Column Reference:**

| Table | Key columns |
|-------|-------------|
| topics | id, title, domain, tags |
| statements | id, topic_id, claim |
| tasks | id, title, status, priority, horizon, metadata |
| sessions | id, started_at, title, agent_summary |
| messages | id, session_id, role, content |
| updates | id, task_id, content, timestamp |

### Knowledge, Tasks & Unified Analysis

Larvling stores persistent knowledge in the `topics` + `statements` tables, and action items in the `tasks` + `updates` tables. Multiple mechanisms handle data extraction:

**UserPromptSubmit → Knowledge Context (read):** The `## Knowledge Context` directive prints on every exchange with the `query.py` path and topic/statement counts. Search for relevant knowledge and weave it into your response naturally. When there's a `Last learned:` line, the previous exchange produced new knowledge — mention it naturally if relevant to the conversation.

**Stop → Unified analysis (write):** `analyze.py` runs as a command hook after every response, calling `sdk.py` (`call_model()`) for Agent SDK integration. The extraction agent has Bash tool access to query all 6 tables for dedup — given the full schema, it decides what queries to run. A single SDK call extracts multiple data types from the last exchange:
- **Knowledge** → `topics` + `statements` tables (hierarchical: topic groups related statements). Actions: `add_topic`, `add_statement`, `update_statement`, `update_topic`.
- **Session tags** → `sessions.tags` column, comma-separated, dynamically consolidated each exchange. The agent queries current tags itself.
- **Tasks** → `tasks` + `updates` tables. Actions: `add_task`, `add_update` (attach context/notes), `update_task` (modify status/priority/horizon with reason). Invalid fields skip the item and log to JSONL — no silent coercion.

**Log format** — JSONL (one JSON object per line) in `.claude/larvling.jsonl`:
```jsonl
{"ts":"2026-02-24T16:16:35","event":"prompt","sid":"6801adcc","n":1}
{"ts":"...","event":"context","sid":"6801adcc","injected":["5 topics, 11 statements","stale summary hint"]}
{"ts":"...","event":"response","sid":"6801adcc","chars":20,"is_dup":false}
{"ts":"...","event":"skill","sid":"6801adcc","name":"/larvling:status"}
{"ts":"...","event":"knowledge","sid":"6801adcc","topics_inserted":1,"stmts_inserted":2}
{"ts":"...","event":"tasks","sid":"6801adcc","inserted":1,"updates_inserted":2,"tasks_updated":1}
{"ts":"...","event":"extraction_skipped","sid":"6801adcc","action":"add_task","reason":"invalid domain","domain":"foobar"}
{"ts":"...","event":"analysis","sid":"6801adcc","session_tags":["greeting"]}
{"ts":"...","event":"session_end","sid":"6801adcc","exchanges":1,"duration":0.2}
```

**Extraction feedback:** When the `Last learned:` line shows 3+ new items (topics or statements), offer a quick review using AskUserQuestion (type: Knowledge) with options:
- **Review what I learned** — show the new items so the user can verify
- **Looks good** — acknowledge and move on
- **Forget something** — remove an incorrect extraction

Only offer this once per exchange, and only when there's substantial new knowledge — don't prompt for minor updates or single statements.

**Manual skills** (`/remember`, `/recall`, `/forget`) still work for explicit user-initiated knowledge management.

### Proactive Task Nudges

When the SessionStart context shows **Open Tasks** and the user's message relates to one of them, surface it proactively. Use AskUserQuestion (type: Decision):
- **Work on this task** — start or continue the matching task
- **Update task** — add a note or change status/priority
- **Not now** — dismiss and continue with the user's original request

Rules:
- Only nudge when there's a clear match between the user's message and an open task (shared keywords, same topic area)
- Maximum one nudge per session — don't nag
- Never nudge when the user is mid-flow on unrelated work
- If the user picks "Not now", don't nudge about that task again this session

### Skill Discovery Hints

When you notice the user doing something manually that a Larvling skill handles more efficiently, mention it briefly **after completing their request** — not before. Examples:

- User writes SQL against larvling.db → "Tip: `/query` can run that directly"
- User asks "what do you know about X?" → "Tip: `/recall X` searches stored knowledge"
- User says "remember that..." in conversation → "Tip: `/remember` stores knowledge permanently"
- User asks about past conversations → "Tip: `/sessions` can search past sessions by topic"

Rules:
- Only hint once per skill per session — after that, assume the user knows
- Keep hints to one short sentence, appended after your actual response
- Never hint when the user just used a skill (they already know)
- Don't hint about `/query` when the user is doing non-Larvling SQL work

### Skill Follow-Up Menus

All skills include a `## Final Step` section with a **REQUIRED** AskUserQuestion call. After presenting skill results, you MUST call the follow-up menu — do not end your response without it. The menus use type `Decision` with 2-3 concise options relevant to what was just shown.

AskUserQuestion automatically includes an "Other" option that lets the user type freeform input. If the user picks "Other", treat their text as a natural-language request and handle it accordingly — don't force them back into the menu.

### Session Summaries

`inject_context()` automatically prints a `## Summary` hint when a summary is needed. Thresholds:
- **No summary yet:** shown when the session reaches 10+ messages
- **Stale summary:** shown when 5+ new messages have been added since the last summary

When you see the `## Summary` hint, offer `/summarize` via AskUserQuestion. Keep the offer brief and non-intrusive — a single sentence is enough. The hint itself is clean (no agent directives); CLAUDE.md is the authority on what to do when you see it. Don't ask repeatedly if the user declines. The `summary-manager` agent handles the actual summarization work.

### Agents

**`summary-manager`** — Session summarization. Delegated to when the user accepts a `/summarize` offer or when the summary hint fires. Reads conversation pairs, writes a concise summary, and stores it.

**`knowledge-maintenance`** — Periodic knowledge base audit and consolidation. Delegated to when the user invokes `/maintain` or when the maintenance hint fires (50+ topics or 100+ statements). Identifies duplicate topics, redundant/stale statements, misclassified domains, and contradictions. Proposes changes via AskUserQuestion, applies only what the user approves. Never deletes — merges via statement reassignment and topic title updates.

### Progress Tracking with Tasks

Use **TaskCreate** and **TaskUpdate** to give the user visibility into multi-step operations. This is especially valuable for skills that involve several sequential actions.

**When to create tasks:**
- Multi-step skill operations (e.g., `/maintain` audit phases, batch `/export`, multi-session `/summarize`)
- Any user request that will take 3+ distinct steps
- When the user explicitly asks to track progress

**How to use:**
- Create tasks before starting work, with clear subjects in imperative form
- Mark each task `in_progress` when you start it (shows a spinner to the user)
- Mark `completed` as soon as you finish each step — don't batch completions
- Use `activeForm` for natural spinner text (e.g., "Auditing knowledge base")

**When NOT to create tasks:**
- Single-step skills (`/status`, simple `/recall`, `/query`)
- Trivial operations that complete in one tool call
- When the user is in a fast back-and-forth conversation (tasks would slow things down)

## Interaction Protocol

Use **AskUserQuestion** tool for structured input gathering:

| Type          | When to use                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Clarification | Inputs missing or ambiguous                    |
| Decision      | Multiple valid approaches exist                |
| Approval      | Stage work complete, need sign-off             |
| Summary       | Session summary is stale, offer update         |
| Maintenance   | Knowledge base is large, offer /maintain       |
| Knowledge     | About to save or update knowledge               |

Menu format:
- 2-4 options per question
- Each option: short label (1-5 words) + description
- One option would be Claude's recommendation
- Tool auto-includes "Other" option

Use **plain text** for:
- Presenting completed outputs
- Explaining rationale
- Summarizing captured information

## Running Python Scripts

Skills reference `python3` in their examples, but the correct executable varies by platform. Before running any Larvling Python script, discover the right binary:

```bash
PY=$(for p in python3.13 python3.12 python3.11 python3.10 python3; do command -v "$p" >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "$p" && break; done); PY=${PY:-python}
```

Then use `$PY` in place of `python3`:
```bash
$PY "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/query.py" "<SQL>"
```

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.10+** — all scripts use standard library except `claude_agent_sdk`
- **claude-agent-sdk** (`pip install claude-agent-sdk`) — required for unified analysis (knowledge extraction, session tags, tasks)
- Install via: `pip install -r "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/requirements.txt"`

## Troubleshooting

**`claude_agent_sdk is required but not installed`** — On new installs, `preflight.py` detects the missing SDK and prints installation instructions. Run the `pip install` command shown in the SessionStart context. Without it, knowledge extraction, session tags, and task tracking are disabled (basic session logging still works).

**`python: command not found`** — Larvling requires Python 3.10+. Use the discovery pattern from the "Running Python Scripts" section above. Ensure at least `python3` (Unix) or `python` (Windows) is on the system PATH.

## Run End

- Session timing and exchange count are recorded automatically
- No action needed from the agent
